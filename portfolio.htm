						<h2>ESTUARIES.GOV</h2>
						<p>This application was built as a module for the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) / National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) “Estuaries 101″ program and hosted on the estuaries.gov website.</p>
					
						<p>It is a web application driven by data retrieved from the Central Data Management Office (CDMO) SOAP webservices and allows the user to interact using a map display and plotting tools to plot multi-variate graphs, zoom in and out (both on the map and on the plotted data), generate full color PDFs of plotted data, generate statistics for data series, and export data for further analysis as comma seperated value data files.</p>

						<h2>NRDC ARCTIC MAPPING</h2>
						<p>In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) held workshops that explored methods of ecosystem-based management for the Arctic marine environment. NBT Solutions was contracted to aid NRDC, IUCN staff and workshop participants with all areas of mapping and GIS data needs. This included map making, data acquisition, data manipulation, analysis and logistics.</p>
						
						<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><span>To collect environmental data specific to project boundary</span></li>
							<li><span>To collect species data specific to the project boundary</span></li>
							<li><span>Develop a visually pleasing basemap to display data sets</span></li>
							<li><span>Develop online interactive mapper to display data sets</span></li>
							<li><span>Accompany IUCN and NRDC staff to the La Jolla workshop as the technical mapping lead</span></li>
							<li><span>Capture and display information from workshop participants into a working GIS environment</span></li>
							<li><span>Make necessary data edits based on post workshop reviews</span></li>
							<li><span>Output final areas of importance (EBSA, SuperEBSA)</span></li>
							<li><span>Output final maps to be used in post workshop report</span></li>
						</ul>	
					
						<p>One of the key activities that made these workshops successful was NBT Solutions’ ability to work closely with workshop participants, gathering their input and feedback and translating this information into maps and interactive displays on a project web site.</p>

						<h2>CBIBS</h2>
						<p>NBT Solutions staff was responsible for the system architecture of the CBIBS system and public facing website. CBIBS is a 9-buoy system of observational buoy platforms located around the Chesapeake Bay, operated by the NOAA Chesapeake Bay office. Designed for public use (ie. recreational boaters and fishermen) and educational consumption (via science modules built into the website and by third parties) of observational data, NBT Solutions partnered with Tellus Applied Sciences to design, build and maintain the data management system. Data was made available via the website, a toll-free interactive phone application (1-877-BUOYBAY, built in partnership with Verizon), and Android and iPhone apps.</p>
					
						<p>The data management system consists of a back-end database (MySQL) and a middleware service layer (SOAP/XML-RPC) developed in PHP. To date, the database has stored over 25 million observations, all of them transmitted in near real-time over a cellular connection to the buoys. The middleware layer was built both as a technical underpinning of the website and as a developer portal, allowing third party organizations to build their own applications using the data from the buoys. For example, The National Geographic Society built the FieldScope application using CBIBS data by acting as a third-party developer.</p>
						
						<p>The CBIBS system was developed using completely open source standards and tools, including PHP, Apache, MySQL and SOAP.</p>

						<h2>DTE ENERGY</h2>
						<p>To help its residential, commercial, and industrial customers meet energy efficiency goals, DTE hired ICF International and NBT Solutions to develop an online tool to help these customers search for contractors that provide specific energy efficiency services.</p>
					
						<p>The application allows users to enter a location and specify the types of services they are interested in. The application then returns a list of contractors that meet the users’ criteria, a map showing the locations of the contractors, and detailed information about the contractor including any reviews of that contractor.</p>

						<h2>WEATHERIZATION PLUS</h2>
						<p>The National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP) hired ICF and NBT Solutions to develop a web mapping solution that allows Weatherization Plus and Healthy Home providers to easily locate each other and work collaboratively on the whole-house approach to energy efficiency and safety improvements. Through an easy to use online map, users have access to a full library of providers including name, location, and contact information. The web mapping solution was built using a combination of open source geospatial tools and ESRI map services.</p>
					
						<p>Weatherization Plus describes the evolution of the Weatherization Assistance Program from its traditional focus on heating and cooling energy conservation to an expanded focus on whole-house energy usage and whole-community efforts. The whole-house approach incorporates advanced technologies and addresses the comprehensive energy usage in low income homes, as well as related health and safety improvements. The whole-community approach enables weatherization providers to serve as a resource for community-based efforts to conserve energy, boost economic activity, and improve the environment.</p>
